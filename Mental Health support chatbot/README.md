Mental Health Support Chatbot

Mental health is a growing concern globally. Many people struggle to get timely help due to stigma, cost, or unavailability of therapists. This chatbot provides initial support, helping users talk about their feelings and access helpful resources.

Create a Mental Health Support Chatbot using Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and a GUI. It detects emotional tone in user input and provides appropriate responses or self-help tips.

This project aims to do following 
Detect emotions in user messages (happy, sad, angry, anxious).
Provide relevant mental health tips and encouragement.
Offer emergency contact suggestions for serious messages.
Simple GUI using tkinter.
